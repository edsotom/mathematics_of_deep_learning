# Introduction to the Theorical Machine Learning 
In this repo you encounter with the compilation of my work trought the course "Intro. to theorical ML" at Unal, in 2021. The repo takes care in two matters: homeworks and a course project. The homeworks are solutions of exercise sets of the book <a href='https://work.caltech.edu/textbook.html' target='_blank'>Learning from Data</a>, by Yaser S, Malik and Hsuan. The final project comprise the study of the paper <a href='http://proceedings.mlr.press/v125/steinke20a/steinke20a.pdf' target='_blank'>Reasoning About Generalization Via Conditional Mutual Information</a> by Thomas Steinke and Lydia Zakynthinou presented in the COLT-2020, the study is based on presenting the results in relation to the course contents.
## Homeworks solutions
<ul>
  <li>Here's the link to my <a href='https://github.com/EdwardSoto/Intro-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Homework%20%231%20ML.ipynb' target='_blank'>Homework 1 Solutions</a>, comprising the problem setup, types of learning and the question "is learning feasible?". <br>
  <li>Here's the link to my <a href='https://github.com/EdwardSoto/Intro-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Homework%232_ML.ipynb' target='_blank'>Homework 2 Solutions</a>, comprising the learning problem and error and noise. <br>
  <li>Here's the link to my <a href='https://github.com/EdwardSoto/Intro-Machine-Learning/blob/master/ML_Homework%233.ipynb' target='_blank'>Homework 3 Solutions</a>, comprising the theory of generalization, interpreting the generalization bound and approximation-generalization tradeoff.
