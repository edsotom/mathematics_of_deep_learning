# Mathematics of Deep Learning
In this repo you'll find all my work trough the course "Mathematics of Deep Learning" from the Applied Mathematics Master's Degree at Unal, in 2023. The work is divided into two topics: firstly, four Jupyter notebooks covering the implementation of learning algorithms and the study of some theoretical problems. Secondly, a group work in the stufy of one theoretical article.

The four jupyter notebooks are:
<ul>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/edsotom/mathematics_of_deep_learning/blob/master/First_HW.ipynb' target='_blank'>Homework 1</a>: describring two datasets that will be used along the implementation of some learning models in the next notebook. Also, we answer some theorical questions about generalization and problem setup over these datasets.<br>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/edsotom/mathematics_of_deep_learning/blob/master/ML_algorithms_implementation.ipynb' target='_blank'>Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation</a>: implementation of logistic regression, SVM, decision tree and KNN algorithms in the two datasets provided from homework 1. Each algorithm, along with other machine learning topics, was implemented using sklearn.<br>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/edsotom/mathematics_of_deep_learning/blob/master/theoretical_exercises.ipynb' target='_blank'>Theorical Exercises</a>: comprising the problem setup, types of learning and the question "is learning feasible?" from the book <a href='https://work.caltech.edu/textbook.html' target='_blank'>Learning from Data</a>, by Yaser S, Malik and Hsuan.
  <li><a href='https://github.com/edsotom/mathematics_of_deep_learning/blob/master/eigen_faces.ipynb' target='_blank'>Eigenfaces</a>: an implementation of the principal component analysis algorithm (PCA) on a face image dataset.
</ul>

The study paper was "Mathematics of Deep Learning" by Rene Vidal, Joan Bruna, Raja Giryes and Stefano Soatto. The self group study cover a review of the paper divided in three parts:
<ul>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/edsotom/mathematics_of_deep_learning/blob/master/theoric_article_presentation/Mathematics_of_Deep_Learning_ppt.pdf' target='_blank'>Presentation</a>: used to explain the main ideas of the paper to our classmates in a formal presentation.<br>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/edsotom/mathematics_of_deep_learning/blob/master/theoric_article_presentation/Mathematics_of_Deep_Learning_report.pdf' target='_blank'>Report</a>: article style documment to compile the review grouo study.<br>
  <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqzyhTxIZ0s&ab_channel=MayraVega' target='_blank'>Ressume Video</a>: same ideas as the presentation but in video. 
</ul>
