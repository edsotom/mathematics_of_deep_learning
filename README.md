# Mathematics of Deep Learning
In this repo you'll find all my self work trough the course "Mathematics of Deep Learning" from the applied mathematics master's degree at Unal, in 2023. The repo is divided in 4 jupyter notebooks: 
<ul>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/edsotom/mathematics_of_deep_learning/blob/master/First_HW.ipynb' target='_blank'>Homework 1</a>: describring two datasets that will be used along the implementation of some learning models in the next notebook. Also, we answer some theorical questions about generalization and problem setup over these datasets.<br>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/edsotom/mathematics_of_deep_learning/blob/master/ML_algorithms_implementation.ipynb' target='_blank'>Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation</a>: implementation of logistic regression, SVM, decision tree and KNN algorithms in the two datasets provided from homework 1. Each algorithm, along with other machine learning topics, was implemented using sklearn.<br>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/edsotom/mathematics_of_deep_learning/blob/master/theoretical_exercises.ipynb' target='_blank'>Theorical Exercises</a>: comprising the problem setup, types of learning and the question "is learning feasible?" from the book <a href='https://work.caltech.edu/textbook.html' target='_blank'>Learning from Data</a>, by Yaser S, Malik and Hsuan.
  <li><a href='https://github.com/edsotom/mathematics_of_deep_learning/blob/master/eigen_faces.ipynb' target='_blank'>Eigenfaces</a>: an implementation of the principal component analysis algorithm (PCA) on a face image dataset.
</ul>
